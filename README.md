### Dockerfile

In the directory of the project, there is a `Dockerfile` which was developed to ensure reproducibility of the deployment of this application. The first time building may take a while, since it has to install every R package used by the app. We built this `Dockerfile` above the __rocker/shiny:3.6.1__ image.

Since this deploy (with Dockerfile) is based on a Shiny Server, the default port mapped to the Docker Container is TCP/3838. Deployment with other technology stacks is possible, but the R version, and package snapshots must be referring to R 3.6.1, otherwise we cannot ensure the reproducibility of the analysis.

To run this app individually, the user must be at the root directory of this project and run the following commands:

```shell
docker build -t crypto_diversifier .
docker run --name crypto_diversifier_container -p 3838:3838 -d crypto_diversifier
```

This will run the app and host it at [localhost](http://localhost:3838/diversified_crypto)
