### Description
    
  I'm a Data Scientist working at Agibank, a financial institution based in Porto Alegre, Brazil, engaged mainly with predictive modelling and fraud detection using open-source technologies. Previously, I worked as a Postdoctoral Scholar at the Center for Geospatial Sciences at the University of California, Riverside (UCR) under the supervision of Serge Rey. I am also a Core Developer of the Python Spatial Analysis Library (PySAL).

  I hold a Ph.D. in Economics from the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul (2017) (with Honorable Mention), a Master's in Statistics from the Federal University of Minas Gerais (2014) and a Bachelor's in Statistics from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (2010). Besides, I also worked as a researcher in statistics at the Statistics and Economics Foundation in southern Brazil for eight years and was a professor of Data Analysis with R at the Data Science and Big Data post-graduation of UniRitter university.
